### Heya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® with 25+ years of experience. I'm a huge fan of `open source`, `privacy` `self hosting` and `IndieWeb`.

I feel that the Internet used to be much better and a lot more fun in the early 2000s. If you don't have a homepage or a blog with an RSS feed, now is the perfect time to create one!

Most of my repos are just small projects I created for myself, but feel free to use them. Over the years, I have been using many programming languages. At the moment, I'm mostly using `Go` for backend stuff and `vanilla JavaScript` for frontend stuff.

Other things I like:
- Reading
- Video games and board games
- Endurance sports (running)
- Traveling
- Urbanism
